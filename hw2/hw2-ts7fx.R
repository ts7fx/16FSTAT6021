# according to the summary, p-value = 0.0159. So for any alpha > 0.0159, we would reject H0:B1=0 and conclude that
# there is indeed a linear relationship between y and x_5. That is, fuel consumption can be explained in a linear regression
# relationship by the initial boiling point of the fuel. 

# more specifically, the coefficient for x_5 is -0.26376. That is, for every 1 degree C incress in the initial boiling point 
# of the fuel, there is a -0.26376g/km decrease in fuel consumption.

# R-squared in this case = 0.3493, which means 34.93% of the variance in fuel consumption can be explained by the initial 
# boiling point of the fuel.

#   Multiple R-squared:  0.1413

# according to the summary, the p-value for x_3 is 0.034, which means for all alpha > 0.034, we reject the null hypotheses
# of B1 = 0 and conclude that there exists a linear relationship between overall quality rating of a wine and its total SO2
# content.

# Moreover, the coefficient B1 = -0.012762. That means for every 1 ppm increase in total SO2 content of a wine, its corresponding
# overall quality rating drop by 0.012762 of a unit measure.

# In this case, R-squared is 0.1413, which means 14.13% of the variance in the overall quality rating of a wine can be 
# explained by its total SO2 content.

# P value is this case is 0.648. Which means for a widely used a=0.05 hypotheses test, we would accept H0 and conclude
