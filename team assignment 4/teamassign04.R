## Question 1: ##
#################

# For each part of this problem, you are to create (or find) a data set with about 30 observations 
# that is suitable for simple linear regression and satisfies the given specifications. If it is 
# not possible, explain why it is not possible. For each part, include a plot that shows the 
# interesting points.
#
#   (a) The data set has a point that is clearly visible for all four types of residuals 
#       discussed -- standardized, studentized, PRESS, R-student.
#   (b) The data set has a point that stands out when viewing studentized residuals but not 
#       when viewing standardized residuals.
#   (c) The data set has a point that stands out when viewing PRESS residuals but not when 
#       viewing standardized residuals.
#   (d) The data set has a point that stands out when viewing R-student residuals but not when 
#       viewing standardized residuals.
#   (e) The data set has a point that stands out when viewing PRESS residuals but not when 
#       viewing studentized residuals.
#   (f) The data set has a point that stands out when viewing R-student residuals but not when 
#       viewing PRESS residuals.

## Question 2: ##
#################

# For each part of this problem, you are to create (or find) a data set with about 30 observations 
# that is suitable for simple linear regression and satisfies the given specifications on the variance
# of the residuals. For each part, include a plot of your residuals that shows the required characteristic.
#
#   (a) The residuals have constant variance.
#   (b) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y).
#   (c) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)^2.
#   (d) The residuals have variance proportional to 1/E(y).
#   (e) The residuals have variance proportional to C-E(y) for some constant C.
#   (f) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)(C-E(y)) for some constant C.
